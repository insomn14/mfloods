## About

`mfloods` is a high-performance HTTP request flooding tool written in Rust, designed for load testing and stress testing web applications.

- üöÄ **High Performance**: Built with Rust for maximum speed and efficiency
- üîÑ **Parallel Processing**: Configurable multi-threading for concurrent requests
- üåê **Proxy Support**: HTTP, HTTPS, and SOCKS5 proxy support
- üîí **SSL Options**: Configurable SSL certificate verification
- üìä **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress bar for large request batches
- üìù **Flexible Input**: Raw HTTP request files for complete control
- üéØ **Connection Pooling**: Efficient connection management to prevent resource exhaustion
- üìà **Detailed Logging**: Multiple log levels for debugging and monitoring

## Project Structure & Source Code

- **This repository (`mfloods`)**: Contains only the compiled binaries (in the `release/` directory) and documentation for public distribution.
- **Source code repository (`mfloods-src`)**: The full Rust source code is maintained in a separate, private repository. If you are interested in contributing or reviewing the source, please contact the maintainer.

> **Note:** The source code is not included here for distribution purposes. This split helps keep the public release focused on easy-to-use binaries, while development and contributions are managed privately.

## Quick Start

### Download

Download the latest release for your platform from the [Releases](https://github.com/insomn14/mfloods/releases) page.

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Single request
./mfloods request.txt

# Multiple requests with threading
./mfloods -num 100 -th 4 request.txt

# With proxy
./mfloods -num 50 -th 2 -proxy http://proxy:8080 request.txt

# With SSL bypass for proxy
./mfloods -insecure -proxy http://127.0.0.1:8080 request.txt
```

## Command Line Options

| Option | Description | Default |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `-h, --help` | Show help message | - |
| `-log <level>` | Set log level (error, warn, info, debug, trace) | info |
| `-num <count>` | Number of requests to make | 1 |
| `-th <threads>` | Number of threads for parallel processing | 1 |
| `-proxy <url>` | Proxy URL (http://, https://, socks5://) | none |
| `-insecure` | Disable SSL certificate verification | false |

## Log Levels

- **error**: Only error messages
- **warn**: Warnings and errors
- **info**: Important information with progress bar (default)
- **debug**: Detailed information including headers
- **trace**: Most detailed information

## HTTP Request File Format

Create a text file containing a raw HTTP request:

```
POST /api/endpoint HTTP/2
Host: example.com
User-Agent: mfloods/1.0
Content-Type: application/json
Accept: */*
Connection: keep-alive

{"key": "value"}
```

## Use Cases

### Load Testing
```bash
# Test with 1000 requests using 8 threads
./mfloods -num 1000 -th 8 -log info request.txt
```

### Proxy Testing
```bash
# Test through HTTP proxy
./mfloods -num 100 -th 4 -proxy http://127.0.0.1:8080 request.txt

# Test through SOCKS5 proxy
./mfloods -num 100 -th 4 -proxy socks5://127.0.0.1:9050 request.txt
```

### SSL/Proxy Scenarios
```bash
# Bypass SSL verification for proxy testing
./mfloods -insecure -proxy http://127.0.0.1:8080 request.txt
```

## Performance Features

- **Connection Pooling**: Reuses connections to reduce overhead
- **Resource Management**: Automatic cleanup of idle connections
- **Concurrency Control**: Limits concurrent connections to prevent resource exhaustion
- **Timeout Protection**: Prevents hanging requests from consuming resources
